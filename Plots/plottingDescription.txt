Plots the experiments in a few different ways using command_outputs files placed in inside ./Game

Parameters:
    --window=<WINDOW_SIZE>      - smooting of this size will be applied to each plot
                                - default=10
    --option=<OPTION_NUMBER>    - There are 3 different types of plots:
                                    1. Plot each experiment separately - 1 file to 1 plot
                                        Only option that shows the policy that the agent uses
                                        If a file is not correct it will skip it
                                    2. Plot each experiment by taking the average of all different seeds for that experiment and
                                        do so for each learning agent - numOfSeeeds * numOfLearningAgents files to 1 plot
                                        If a file is not correct it will skip the whole group
                                - default=1

Example run: ./plot.py --window=100 --option=2
