- Plots the experiments in a few different ways using command_outputs files placed in inside ./Game
- There are 3 different types of plots:
    1. Plot each experiment separately - 1 file to 1 plot
        Only option that shows the policy that the agent uses
        If a file is not correct it will simply skip it
    2. Plot each experiment by taking the average of all different seeds for that experiment - numOfSeeds files to 1 plot
        All files of the specified seeds need to be correct and all have to contain the same number of games
    3. Plots the same thing as the 2nd option, but it does so for each learning agent - numOfSeeeds * numOfLearningAgents files to 1 Plot

- To run either of the options simply add --option=<OPTION_NUMBER>
