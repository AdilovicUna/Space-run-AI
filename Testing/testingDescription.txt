Runs multiple experiments with specified parameters

By 1 experiment we take an average of n*m games 
    (with n games run with 1 seed m times)

Immutable and mutable parameters:
    immutable - 
        each experiment is runs with the same value
        options:
            n - number of games (positive int)
                (default: 100)
            
            stoppingPoint - stop after the agent wins this many consecutive games 
                            (default: 10)

            m - range of the different seeds used for one experiment 
                (default: [0,9] inclusive)

            env -   list of obstacles that will be chosen in the game 
                    Any subset of: [Traps, Bugs, Viruses, Tokens, 
                                    I, O, MovingI, X, Walls, Hex, 
                                    HexO, Balls, Triangles, HalfHex,
                                    Worm, LadybugFlying, LadybugWalking,
                                    Rotavirus, Bacteriophage]
                    (default: all)
            
            agent - name of the agent
                    Any subset of: [MonteCarlo, SARSA, QLearning, 
                                    ExpectedSARSA, DoubleQLearning]
                    (default: MonteCarlo)   

            shooting -  enable or disable shooting   (enabled,disabled)   
                        (default: disabled)    

            level - number of the level to start from 
                    One of: [1, ... , 10] 
                    (default: 1)   

            database -  read = read the data for this command from an existing file 
                        write = update the data after the command is executed 
                        One of: [read, write, read_write] 
                        (default: write)   
        
            ceval - performs continuous evaluation  (true,false)   
                    (default: true) 
                            
            debug - display debug print statements  (true,false)   
                    (default: false)               
    
    mutable - 
        the value changes (typically within a range) btw experiments
        these are sub-options parameters for each agent:
            gam - range [0,1] (default: 1.0)        
            eps - range [0,1] (default: 0.2)  
            epsFinal - range [0,1] (default: 0.0001)  
            initOptVal - range [0,~) (default: 100.0)  
        they are passed in the form: [min,max(not inclusive),step] (look at example usages below)

Top level experiment options:
    all_traps, all_bugs, all_viruses - 
        run experiments for each individual trap, bug or virus respectively
    all_agents - run experiments with each learning agent
    all_shooting - runs experiments with both shooting on and off
    note: these options overwrite equivalent env, agent, shooting immutable options

note: rots and dists vals for each env are hardcoded and cannot be changed
    
Example usages:
    - 'test.py --description'
    - 'test.py'
    - 'test.py --m=[0,4] --n=1000 --all_agents --env=[I,O] --ceval=true'
